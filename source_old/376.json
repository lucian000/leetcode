The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence. \n", "\n", "For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.\n", "\n", "Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence.
