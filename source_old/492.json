So, given a specific rectangular web page\u2019s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:\n", "1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.\n", "2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.\n", "3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.\n", "\n", "You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "Example:\n", "\n", "Input: 4\n", "Output: [2, 2]\n", "Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. \n", "But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2].
