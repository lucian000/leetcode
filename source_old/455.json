But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.\n", "\n", "\n", "Note:\n", "You may assume the greed factor is always positive. \n", "You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.\n", "\n", "\n", "Example 1:\n", "\n", "Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]\n", "\n", "Output: 1\n", "\n", "Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies.
