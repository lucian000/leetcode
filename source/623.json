And N's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root, its original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root. If depth d is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all, then create a tree node with value v as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.\n", "\n", "Example 1:\n", "\n", "Input: \n", "A binary tree as following:\n", "       4\n", "     /   \\\n", "    2     6\n", "   / \\   / \n", "  3   1 5   \n", "\n", "v = 1\n", "\n", "d = 2\n", "\n", "Output: \n", "       4\n", "      / \\\n", "     1   1\n", "    /     \\\n", "   2       6\n", "  / \\     / \n", " 3   1   5   \n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "Example 2:\n", "\n", "Input: \n", "A binary tree as following:\n", "      4\n", "     /   \n", "    2    \n", "   / \\   \n", "  3   1    \n", "\n", "v = 1\n", "\n", "d = 3\n", "\n", "Output: \n", "      4\n", "     /   \n", "    2\n", "   / \\    \n", "  1   1\n", " /     \\  \n", "3       1\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "Note:\n", "\n", "The given d is in range [1, maximum depth of the given tree + 1].\n", "The given binary tree has at least one tree node.\n", "\n", "\n"], "filename": "623.add-one-row-to-tree.py"}
