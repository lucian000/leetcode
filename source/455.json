But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nYou may assume the greed factor is always positive. \r\nYou cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n\r\nInput: [1,2,3], [1,1]\r\n\r\nOutput: 1\r\n\r\nExplanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. \r\nAnd even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.\r\nYou need to output 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n\r\nInput: [1,2], [1,2,3]\r\n\r\nOutput: 2\r\n\r\nExplanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. \r\nYou have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, \r\nYou need to output 2.\r\n\r\n","templates":[{"value":"cpp","text":"C++","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\npublic:\r\n    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n};"},{"value":"java","text":"Java","defaultCode":"public class Solution {\r\n    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"python","text":"Python","defaultCode":"class Solution(object):\r\n    def findContentChildren(self, g, s):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type g: List[int]\r\n        :type s: List[int]\r\n        :rtype: int\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        "},{"value":"c","text":"C","defaultCode":"int findContentChildren(int* g, int gSize, int* s, int sSize) {\r\n    \r\n}"},{"value":"csharp","text":"C#","defaultCode":"public class Solution {\r\n    public int FindContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"javascript","text":"JavaScript","defaultCode":"/**\r\n * @param {number[]} g\r\n * @param {number[]} s\r\n * @return {number}\r\n */\r\nvar findContentChildren = function(g, s) {\r\n    \r\n};"},{"value":"ruby","text":"Ruby","defaultCode":"# @param {Integer[]} g\r\n# @param {Integer[]} s\r\n# @return {Integer}\r\ndef find_content_children(g, s)\r\n    \r\nend"},{"value":"swift","text":"Swift","defaultCode":"class Solution {\r\n    func findContentChildren(_ g: [Int], _ s: [Int]) -> Int {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}"},{"value":"golang","text":"Go","defaultCode":"func findContentChildren(g []int, s []int) int {\r\n    \r\n}"},{"value":"scala","text":"Scala","defaultCode":"object Solution {\n    def findContentChildren(g: Array[Int], s: Array[Int]): Int = {\n        \n    }\n}"}],"testcase":"[1,2,3]\n[1,1]","testable":true}
