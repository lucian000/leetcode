Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class.
